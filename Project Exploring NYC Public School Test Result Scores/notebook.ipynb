There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"import pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# The best math results are at least 80% of the *maximum possible score of 800* for math.\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"] >= 0.8 * 800][[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]]\nbest_math_schools = best_math_schools.sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\n\n# Calculate total SAT score\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[[\"average_math\", \"average_reading\", \"average_writing\"]].sum(axis=1)\n\n# Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?\nborough_stats = schools.groupby(\"borough\")[\"total_SAT\"].agg(\n    num_schools=\"size\",  # Number of schools in each borough\n    average_SAT=\"mean\",  # Mean total SAT score for each borough\n    std_SAT=\"std\"        # Standard deviation of total SAT score for each borough\n)\n\n# Round all numeric values to 2 decimal places\nborough_stats = borough_stats.round(2)\n\n# Find the borough with the largest standard deviation\nlargest_std_dev = borough_stats.loc[[borough_stats[\"std_SAT\"].idxmax()]]\n\n# Top 10 best performing schools\nsorted_schools = schools[[\"school_name\", \"total_SAT\"]].sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False)\ntop_10_schools = sorted_schools.head(10)","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":5034,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"import pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# The best math results are at least 80% of the *maximum possible score of 800* for math.\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"] >= 0.8 * 800][[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]]\nbest_math_schools = best_math_schools.sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\n\n# Calculate total SAT score\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[[\"average_math\", \"average_reading\", \"average_writing\"]].sum(axis=1)\n\n# Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?\nborough_stats = schools.groupby(\"borough\")[\"total_SAT\"].agg(\n    num_schools=\"size\",  # Number of schools in each borough\n    average_SAT=\"mean\",  # Mean total SAT score for each borough\n    std_SAT=\"std\"        # Standard deviation of total SAT score for each borough\n)\n\n# Round all numeric values to 2 decimal places\nborough_stats = borough_stats.round(2)\n\n# Find the borough with the largest standard deviation\nlargest_std_dev = borough_stats.loc[[borough_stats[\"std_SAT\"].idxmax()]]\n\n# Top 10 best performing schools\nsorted_schools = schools[[\"school_name\", \"total_SAT\"]].sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False)\ntop_10_schools = sorted_schools.head(10)","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1750081627320,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":395,"type":"stream"}},"lastExecutedByKernel":"9b4a76cb-e254-417a-b85d-c2bfb3895d00"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
